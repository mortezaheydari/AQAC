                <h2>History</h2>
                <div class="large-8 columns"><p>“Architecture is art;” that's how Architect Abdullah Mohammed Qabazard sees and treats his occupation in life. With 40 years of experience across a range of architectural disciplines, from the simple to the complex, the private to public projects.</p>

                <p>It was while studying at the University of Arizona that he first began shaping a design philosophy that has only deepened and broadened over time. Inspired by the Southwestern landscape, Qabazard learned to appreciate the sun and its influence in shaping architectural lines and styles. This was the catalyst for his development as an architect, bringing with it a profound love of art, nature, and the various expressions of beauty. </p>

                <p>In the early 70’s he worked for the Ministry of Public Works (MPW) as Head of the Design Division. This position exposed him to various governmental projects, such as the Ministries Complex (Al-Mirqab), The Ice Skating Rink and more. By the early 80’s, Qabazard had left the ministry and began to freelance on a number of family real estate projects, commercial buildings and villas before joining ARCHICENTRE  in 1984 as the Deputy Design Director. 
                In 1992, Qabazard established Abdullah Qabazard Architecture Consultants (AQAC), a boutique firm offering personalized, one-on-one services aimed at pursuing projects that highlight the region's heritage and culture.</p>

                <p>Qabazard has extensive experience, as lead architect and designer, in governmental, educational and commercial projects, both in Kuwait and abroad. These include: the Al-Seef Palace Extension, where he was one of the lead designers of the concept and design development as well as design liaison during execution; he adopted the same role for the Safat Al-Ghanim showroom in Al-Rai for Al-Ghanim Industries; he took charge of the conceptual design for Kuwait Airport Mall; the same can be said for the Conference/Lecture Hall building at Shuwaikh Campus – Kuwait University, for which his duties ran the gamut from conceptual design to construction follow-up.</p>  
                <p>As for residential projects, Qabazard has acted, since the late 90's, as lead architect and designer on a multitude of projects, ranging from simple villas and private residences to chalets and multipurpose tents to royal palaces. </p>

                <p>It is a passion that he's passed to his own children; Mr. Hamid Qabazard received a degree in Architecture from the University of Louisiana, where he worked with the Building Institute during Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. It is an experience that has afforded him a unique skill set of realizing project completion with minimum resources and in harsh conditions. He joined AQAC in 2007 and now acts as Design Development Team Coordinator, working with his father to provide personalized services to their clients while furthering the firm's unique design philosophy. Together they work towards representing the culture and heritage of Kuwait while utilizing the latest technologies and environmental considerations to enhance their concepts.</p>

                <p>In his own words,  Qabazard is “passionate about representing our culture.” He believes architecture is a reflection of where we stand as a country. It's a way of telling our national story - where we've been and where we're going. </p>
